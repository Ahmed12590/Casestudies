## About

This repository contains a series of **front-end case studies** that demonstrate modern UI/UX concepts, animations, and responsive design techniques.  
Each mini-project explores different aspects of creative web design â€” from smooth animations using **GSAP** to interactive carousels using **Swiper.js**.

These case studies serve as both **portfolio samples** and **learning experiments** for mastering front-end motion design and layout techniques.
